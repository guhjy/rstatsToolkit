Package: rstatsToolkit
Title: Bundles up all my most used functions for doing statistical analysis
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Luke W Johnston <lwjohnst@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: This package is mainly my personal collection of code that I
    commonly use in my research and statistical analysis.  Eventually I would
    like to develop it into a toolkit that other graduate students (I'm a
    graduate student right now btw) and in the future for my own graduate
    students to use and develop.  Until that point, I am slowly developing this
    package into toolkit for analyzing and exploring data.
