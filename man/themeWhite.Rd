\usage{
themeWhite()
}
\description{
Creates a white, simple theme for \pkg{ggplot2} objects
}
\details{
The default \pkg{ggplot2} theme is decent for most purposes, but
is visually unappealing.  This function aims to correct that by
setting the theme to something more similar to the default in the
base R plot package.  The function dependes on \pkg{ggplot2}.
